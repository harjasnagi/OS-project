Q 22: WAP that implements FIFO page replacement algo. First, generate a random
	page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9. Apply the 
	random page-reference string to each algo, and record the number of page
	faults incurred by each algo. Implement the replacement algo so that the
	number of page frames can vary from 1 to 7. Assume that demand paging is
	used.
